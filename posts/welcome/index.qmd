Welcome to my personal research blog! I'm **Siddharth Tumre**, a researcher at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research), where my research focuses on applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for real-world applications.

This space will serve as a platform to:

- 📚 Share insights and updates from my research
- 🛠️ Discuss technical approaches, challenges, and experiments
- 🔎 Reflect on trends in NLP, LLMs, and their applications
- ✍️ Post tutorials, demos, and thoughts.

If you're interested in **applied AI**, **language models**, or how to make cutting-edge NLP work for real-world domains, you're in the right place.
