    "section": "",
    "text": "Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized many industrial applications. However, proprietary LLMs often come with constraints such as restrictions on customizability, high cost and privacy of sensitive data, which make them less viable for industrial applications. Open-source LLMs, on the other hand, provide an accessible and flexible alternative which can enable industries to adapt models to domain-specific needs without such restrictions. This flexibility is especially crucial for manufacturing, chemical processes, construction, energy etc.\nIn this paper, we evaluate and benchmark the feasibility of using Falcon LLM, an open-source model for the task of generating preventive recommendations to improve industrial safety. Based on domain expert evaluation, we find that the standard, pre-trained Falcon LLM has limitations concerning the quality and quantity of recommendations generated. They can be of diverse quality, such as, specific, generic, or irrelevant. We show that the quantity, output format as well as domain-awareness of the model can be significantly improved using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a small amount of labeled data that illustrates the expected output. The quality of recommendations also improves after the fine-tuning; however, there are still many areas of improvement for this task, which we point to in this paper."

    "text": "Abstract\nImproving industrial safety using NLP technologies supports the triple bottom line of environmental, social and economic sustainability. Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has potential to transform the industrial safety and improve disaster mitigation. In this paper, we evaluate and benchmark the feasibility of using Falcon and Phi3 open-source LLMs for the task of generating preventive recommendations to improve industrial safety. Based on domain expert evaluation, we find that the standard, pre-trained LLMs have limitations concerning the quality and quantity of recommendations generated. They can be of diverse quality, such as specific, generic, or irrelevant. We find that the pre-trained version of Phi3 is better than base version of Falcon for the proposed task. We show that the quantity, output format as well as domain-awareness of the Falcon can be significantly improved using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a small amount of labeled data that illustrates the expected output. In spite of the quality improvement post-SFT and the high societal and economic impact of the application, there are still many areas of improvement, which we point to as part of future work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to align LLMs for industrial safety recommendation improvement."

    "text": "Abstract\nKeeping track of the evolving business and technology landscape is essential for enterprises to remain relevant, competitive, and successful in today‚Äôs dynamic marketplace. Gaining insights into how business narratives unfold is crucial for strategic decision-making, risk assessment, and market analysis. For enterprise executives, filtering through vast amounts of news content to identify what is relevant and useful can be extremely time-consuming as well as act as a distraction from other core tasks for their role. Newsletters provide a solution by curating the most relevant information, reducing information overload, and delivering value to targeted readers. Creating periodic newsletters that deliver value to the target audience and achieve business objectives require a combination of domain knowledge, business expertise, and technology awareness across various disciplines‚Äìmaking it an effort-intensive and expensive proposition for enterprises. In this paper, we demonstrate Newsletter-Factory, a tool that can create thematic and customizable newsletters based on enterprise requirements. It efficiently processes huge amounts of data from multiple sources and leverages near-duplicate detection techniques to eliminate redundancy. The tool categorizes news articles into high-level themes and also generates fine-grained sub-labels enabling comprehensive understanding of emerging trends and key narratives. By automating the newsletter creation process, Newsletter-Factory alleviates the pain and cost of creating enterprise newsletters targeted towards business users and employees."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNews aggregators play a key role in the rapidly evolving digital landscape by providing comprehensive and timely news stories aggregated from diverse sources into one feed. As these articles are sourced from different outlets, they often end up covering the same underlying event but differ in phrasing, formatting or supplemented with additional details. It is crucial for the news aggregators to identify these near-duplicates, improving the content quality and user engagement by steering away from redundant information. The problem of near-duplicate news detection has become harder with increasing use of paywalls by the news websites resulting in restricted access to the content. It is now common to get only the headline and a short snippet from the article. Previous works have concentrated on full length versions of documents such as webpages. There is very little work that focuses on this variation of the near-duplicate detection problem in which only headline and a small text blurb is available for each news article. We propose Near-Duplicate Detection Using Metadata Augmented Communities (NDD-MAC) approach that combines embeddings from pretrained language model (PLM) and latent metadata of a news article followed by community detection to identify clusters of near-duplicates. We show the efficacy of proposed approach using 2 different real-world datasets. By integrating metadata with community detection, NDD-MAC is able to detect nuanced similarities and differences in news snippets and offers an industrial scale solution for the near-duplicate detection in scenarios with restricted content availability."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRedundancy and access restriction due to paywalls are emerging as key challenges faced by web-enabled digital news ecosystem. Over the past few years, newspapers and other news sources have increasingly put-up subscription-based paywalls for accessing their content. Further, copyright, and other legal issues have curtailed the amount of text content that can be freely shared in a news feed. Well-known near-duplicate detection algorithms such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants have been used on full length versions of documents such as webpages and news articles. So, unlike traditional input of full text articles, we now get access to significantly less quantity of text available as input. This has added to the challenges and complexities to be tackled by the near-duplicate detection algorithms. There are few, if any, gold-standard datasets available for this variation of the news duplicate detection problem. In this paper, we present NDD-NS, a dataset of business news snippets which have been annotated with near-duplicates. These news snippets are representative of challenges in the content received in the news feed nowadays. Further, we benchmark the Minhash-LSH, Simhash and sentence transformer based neural approaches. We observe that hashing based LSH approaches achieve significantly less accuracy than what it achieved on the SpotSigs dataset. This highlights the challenging nature of the NDD-NS dataset. We believe this dataset will pave way for novel approaches and further research for near-duplicate detection task."

To mitigate these risks, industries often engage specialized agencies to investigate the root causes of accidents and recommend preventive actions to avoid recurrence.

However, the reliability of these models is hindered by issues such as hallucination, raising concerns about their helpfulness in industrial safety. This poses another challenge to assess the quality and feasibility of these generated recommendations. This study aims at exploring the application of LLMs to further categorize these safety recommendations based on the relevance to the safety incident into Specific, Generic, or Irrelevant categories. A total of 2272 generated recommendations were reviewed and annotated as part of gold standard data. We examine the agreement between LLM generated and Human annotated labels for categorization of generated recommendations. Our findings suggest that LLMs currently struggle to accurately categorize their recommendations as specific to incidents. In comparison, traditional supervised learning methods outperform LLMs in recommendation classification tasks.
