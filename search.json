    "text": "Abstract\nKeeping track of the evolving business and technology landscape is essential for enterprises to remain relevant, competitive, and successful in today‚Äôs dynamic marketplace. Gaining insights into how business narratives unfold is crucial for strategic decision-making, risk assessment, and market analysis. For enterprise executives, filtering through vast amounts of news content to identify what is relevant and useful can be extremely time-consuming as well as act as a distraction from other core tasks for their role. Newsletters provide a solution by curating the most relevant information, reducing information overload, and delivering value to targeted readers. Creating periodic newsletters that deliver value to the target audience and achieve business objectives require a combination of domain knowledge, business expertise, and technology awareness across various disciplines‚Äìmaking it an effort-intensive and expensive proposition for enterprises. In this paper, we demonstrate Newsletter-Factory, a tool that can create thematic and customizable newsletters based on enterprise requirements. It efficiently processes huge amounts of data from multiple sources and leverages near-duplicate detection techniques to eliminate redundancy. The tool categorizes news articles into high-level themes and also generates fine-grained sub-labels enabling comprehensive understanding of emerging trends and key narratives. By automating the newsletter creation process, Newsletter-Factory alleviates the pain and cost of creating enterprise newsletters targeted towards business users and employees."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNews aggregators play a key role in the rapidly evolving digital landscape by providing comprehensive and timely news stories aggregated from diverse sources into one feed. As these articles are sourced from different outlets, they often end up covering the same underlying event but differ in phrasing, formatting or supplemented with additional details. It is crucial for the news aggregators to identify these near-duplicates, improving the content quality and user engagement by steering away from redundant information. The problem of near-duplicate news detection has become harder with increasing use of paywalls by the news websites resulting in restricted access to the content. It is now common to get only the headline and a short snippet from the article. Previous works have concentrated on full length versions of documents such as webpages. There is very little work that focuses on this variation of the near-duplicate detection problem in which only headline and a small text blurb is available for each news article. We propose Near-Duplicate Detection Using Metadata Augmented Communities (NDD-MAC) approach that combines embeddings from pretrained language model (PLM) and latent metadata of a news article followed by community detection to identify clusters of near-duplicates. We show the efficacy of proposed approach using 2 different real-world datasets. By integrating metadata with community detection, NDD-MAC is able to detect nuanced similarities and differences in news snippets and offers an industrial scale solution for the near-duplicate detection in scenarios with restricted content availability."
